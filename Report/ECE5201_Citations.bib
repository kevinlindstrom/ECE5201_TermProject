  abstract = {We establish the most general differential equations that are satisfied by the Fourier components of the electromagnetic field diffracted by an arbitrary periodic anisotropic medium. The equations are derived by use of the recently published fast-Fourier-factorization (FFF) method, which ensures fast convergence of the Fourier series of the field. The diffraction by classic isotropic gratings arises as a particular case of the derived equations; the case of anisotropic classic gratings was published elsewhere. The equations can be resolved either through classic differential theory or through the modal method for particular groove profiles. The new equations improve both methods in the same way. Crossed gratings, among which are grids and two-dimensional arbitrarily shaped periodic surfaces, appear as particular cases of the theory, as do three-dimensional photonic crystals. The method can be extended to nonperiodic media through the use of a Fourier transform.},

abstract = {The refractive index, birefringence and their dispersions are analyzed accurately in a physically meaningful model of a dispersion equation having only five coefficients for the calcite and quartz crystals. This dispersion equation is based on the average electronic absorption gap in the UV region and the effective lattice resonance absorption gap in the IR region. The five coefficients of the dispersion equation are different for each fundamental parameters. The dispersion equation for the birefringence leads to represent a standardized equation describing the birefringence of all optical materials.}

abstract = {In this paper, we theoretically design and analyse a wide-angle optical half-wave plate by combining the field transformation (FT) approach with the form-birefringence theory. The FT method is a general approach to manipulate electromagnetic wave propagations from pre-defined boundary conditions and artificial media by design. In theory, the approach is valid for both parallel and perpendicular polarizations. In practice, the resulting medium can be mimicked by a form-birefringent structure which has the same dispersion properties for a wide range of incident angles. A proof concept design for optical half-wave plate is designed for near-infrared operations. The transmittance of proposed device is greater than 0.8 with a polarized state change under 75\&\#x000B0; oblique incidence.},
