\begin{abstract}
	\LaTeX{} manuscripts submitted to Optica Publishing Group journals may use
	these instructions and this universal template format. The template
	simplifies manuscript preparation and eases transfer between journals.
	\emph{Applied Optics}, JOSA A, JOSA B,
	\emph{Journal of Optical Communications and Networking}, and
	\emph{Photonics Research} authors should use the length-check template if
	a precise length estimate is needed. \emph{Optics Letters} authors and
	authors of short \emph{Optica} articles are encouraged to use the length-check template. Authors using this universal template will still need to adhere to article-length restrictions based on the final, published format.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  body  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
Adherence to the specifications listed in this template is essential for
efficient review and publication of submissions. Proper reference format is
especially important (see Section \ref{sec:refs}).

\section{Corresponding author}

We require manuscripts to identify a single corresponding author. The
corresponding author typically is the person who submits the manuscript and
handles correspondence throughout the peer review and publication process.

\begin{verbatim}
\author{Author One\authormark{1} and Author Two\authormark{2,*}}

\address{\authormark{1}Peer Review, Publications Department,
Optica Publishing Group, 2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW,
Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
\authormark{2}Publications Department, Optica Publishing Group,
2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\\

\email{\authormark{*}opex@optica.org}
\end{verbatim}

This format will generate the following appearance:

\bigskip

\author{Author One\authormark{1} and Author Two\authormark{2,*}}

\address{\authormark{1}Peer Review, Publications Department,
	Optica Publishing Group, 2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW,
	Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
	\authormark{2}Publications Department, Optica Publishing Group,
	2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
	%\authormark{3}xyz@optica.org}

	\email{\authormark{*}opex@optica.org}}

\medskip

If other statements about author contribution and contact are needed, they can
be added in addition to the corresponding author designation.
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Author One\authormark{1,3} and Author Two\authormark{2,3,*}}

\address{\authormark{1}Peer Review, Publications Department,
Optica Publishing Group, 2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW,
Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
\authormark{2}Publications Department, Optica Publishing Group,
2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
\authormark{3}The authors contributed equally to this work.\\
\authormark{*}opex@optica.org}}

\section{Abstract}
The abstract should be limited to approximately 100 words. If the work of
another author is cited in the abstract, that citation should be written out
without a number, (e.g., journal, volume, first page, and year in square brackets [Opt. Express {\bfseries 22}, 1234 (2014)]), and a separate citation should be included in the body of the text. The first reference cited in the main text must be [1]. Do not include numbers, bullets, or lists inside the abstract.

\end{figure}


\section{Assessing final manuscript length}
The Universal Manuscript Template is based on the Express journal layout and
will provide an accurate length estimate for \emph{Optics Express},
\emph{Biomedical Optics Express},  \emph{Optical Materials Express}, and our
newest title \emph{Optics Continuum}. \emph{Applied Optics}, JOSAA, JOSAB,
\emph{Optics Letters}, \emph{Optica}, and \emph{Photonics Research} publish
articles in a two-column layout. To estimate the final page count in a
two-column layout, multiply the manuscript page count
(in increments of 1/4 page) by 60\%. For example, 11.5 pages in the Universal
Manuscript Template are roughly equivalent to 7 composed two-column pages. Note
that the estimate is only an approximation, as treatment of figure sizing,
equation display, and other aspects can vary greatly across manuscripts.
Authors of Letters may use the legacy template for a more accurate length
estimate.

\section{Figures, tables, and supplementary materials}

\subsection{Figures and tables}
Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard
\LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{opticafig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Fig. 2, \cite{Yelin:03}).}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Supplementary materials in Optica Publishing Group journals}
Our journals allow authors to include supplementary materials as integral parts
of a manuscript. Such materials are subject to peer-review procedures along
with the rest of the paper and should be uploaded and described using our Prism
manuscript system. Please refer to the
\href{https://opg.optica.org/submit/style/supplementary_materials.cfm}
{Author Guidelines for Supplementary Materials in Optica Publishing Group Journals}
for more detailed instructions on labeling supplementary materials and your manuscript.

\textbf{Authors may also include Supplemental Documents}
(PDF documents with expanded descriptions or methods) with the primary manuscript.
At this time, supplemental PDF files are not accepted for partner titles, JOCN
and \emph{Photonics Research}. To reference the supplementary document, the
statement ``See Supplement 1 for supporting content.'' should appear at the
bottom of the manuscript (above the References heading).

\subsection{Sample Dataset Citation}

1. M. Partridge, "Spectra evolution during coating," figshare (2014),
http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1004612.

\subsection{Sample Code Citation}

2. C. Rivers, "Epipy: Python tools for epidemiology," figshare (2014)
[retrieved 13 May 2015], http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1005064.



\section{Mathematical and scientific notation}

\subsection{Displayed equations} Displayed equations should be centered.
Equation numbers should appear at the right-hand margin, in
parentheses:
\begin{equation}
	J(\rho) =
	\frac{\gamma^2}{2} \; \sum_{k({\rm even}) = -\infty}^{\infty}
	\frac{(1 + k \tau)}{ \left[ (1 + k \tau)^2 + (\gamma  \rho)^2  \right]^{3/2} }.
\end{equation}

All equations should be numbered in the order in which they appear
and should be referenced  from within the main text as Eq. (1),
Eq. (2), and so on [or as inequality (1), etc., as appropriate].

\section{Backmatter}

Backmatter sections should be listed in the order
Funding/Acknowledgment/Disclosures/Data Availability Statement/Supplemental
Document section. An example of backmatter with each of these sections included
is shown below.

\begin{backmatter}
	\bmsection{Funding}
	Content in the funding section will be generated entirely from details
	submitted to Prism. Authors may add placeholder text in the manuscript to
	assess length, but any text added to this section in the manuscript will be
	replaced during production and will display official funder names along with
	any grant numbers provided. If additional details about a funder are
	required, they may be added to the Acknowledgments, even if this duplicates
	information in the funding section. See the example below in Acknowledgements.

	\bmsection{Acknowledgments}
	The section title should not follow the numbering scheme of the body of the
	paper. Additional information crediting individuals who contributed to the
	work being reported, clarifying who received funding from a particular
	source, or other information that does not fit the criteria for the funding
	block may also be included; for example, ``K. Flockhart thanks the National
	Science Foundation for help identifying collaborators for this work.''

	\bmsection{Disclosures}
	Disclosures should be listed in a separate nonnumbered section at the end of
	the manuscript. List the Disclosures codes identified on the
	\href{https://opg.optica.org/submit/review/conflicts-interest-policy.cfm}
	{Conflict of Interest policy page}, as shown in the examples below:

	\medskip

	\noindent ABC: 123 Corporation (I,E,P), DEF: 456 Corporation (R,S). GHI: 789
	Corporation (C).

	\medskip

	\noindent If there are no disclosures, then list ``The authors declare no
	conflicts of interest.''


	\bmsection{Data Availability Statement}
	A Data Availability Statement (DAS) will be required for all submissions
	beginning 1 March 2021. The DAS should be an unnumbered separate section
	titled ``Data Availability'' that
	immediately follows the Disclosures section. See the
	\href{https://opg.optica.org/submit/review/data-availability-policy.cfm}
	{Data Availability Statement policy page} for more information.

	Optica has identified four common (sometimes overlapping) situations that
	authors should use as guidance. These are provided as minimal models, and
	authors should feel free to
	include any additional details that may be relevant.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item When datasets are included as integral supplementary material in
		      the paper, they must be declared (e.g., as "Dataset 1" following our
		      current supplementary materials policy) and cited in the DAS, and should
		      appear in the references.

		      \bmsection{Data availability} Data underlying the results
		      presented in this paper are available in Dataset 1, Ref. [3].

		      \bigskip

		\item When datasets are cited but not submitted as integral
		      supplementary material, they must be cited in the DAS and should appear
		      in the references.

		      \bmsection{Data availability} Data underlying the results
		      presented in this paper are available in Ref. [3].

		      \bigskip

		\item If the data generated or analyzed as part of the research are not
		      publicly available, that should be stated. Authors are encouraged to
		      explain why (e.g.~the data may be restricted for privacy reasons), and
		      how the data might be obtained or accessed in the future.

		      \bmsection{Data availability} Data underlying the results
		      presented in this paper are not publicly available at this time
		      but may be obtained from the authors upon reasonable request.

		      \bigskip

		\item If no data were generated or analyzed in the presented research,
		      that should be stated.

		      \bmsection{Data availability} No data were generated or analyzed
		      in the presented research.
	\end{enumerate}


	\bmsection{Supplemental document}
	See Supplement 1 for supporting content.

\section{References}
\label{sec:refs}
Proper formatting of references is extremely important, not only for consistent
appearance but also for accurate electronic tagging. Please follow the guidelines
provided below on formatting, callouts, and use of Bib\TeX.

\subsection{Formatting reference items}
Each source must have its own reference number. Footnotes (notes at the bottom
of text pages) are not used in our journals. References require all author
names, full titles, and inclusive pagination. Examples of common reference types
can be found in the  \href{https://opg.optica.org/jot/submit/style/oestyleguide.cfm}
{style guide}.


The commands \verb+\begin{thebibliography}{}+ and \verb+\end{thebibliography}+
format the section according to standard style, showing the title {\bfseries References}.
Use the \verb+\bibitem{label}+ command to start each reference.

\subsection{Formatting reference citations}
References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are
referenced in the body of the paper. Set reference callouts with standard
\verb+\cite{}+ command or set manually inside square brackets [1].

To reference multiple articles at once, simply use a comma to separate the
reference labels, e.g. \verb+\cite{Yelin:03,Masajada:13,Zhang:14}+, produces
\cite{Yelin:03,Masajada:13,Zhang:14}.
%Using the \texttt{cite.sty} package will make these citations appear like so: [2--4].

\subsection{Bib\TeX}
\label{sec:bibtex}
Bib\TeX{} may be used to create a file containing the references, whose contents
(i.e., contents of \texttt{.bbl} file) can then be pasted into the bibliography
section of the \texttt{.tex} file. A Bib\TeX{} style file, \texttt{opticajnl.bst},
is provided.

If your manuscript already contains a manually formatted
\verb|\begin{thebibliography}|... \verb|\end{thebibliography}| list, then
delete the \texttt{latexmkrc} file (if present) from your submission files.
However you should ensure that your manually-formatted reference list adheres
to style accurately.

\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, compress your .tex manuscript file and all
figures (which should be in EPS or PDF format) in a ZIP, TAR or TAR-GZIP package.
All files must be referenced at the root level (e.g., file \texttt{figure-1.eps},
not \texttt{/myfigs/figure-1.eps}). If there are supplementary materials, the
associated files should not be included in your manuscript archive but be
uploaded separately through the Prism interface.
